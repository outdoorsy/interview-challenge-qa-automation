# Coding Challenge

Thanks for applying for a QA automation role at Outdoorsy. We've put together this code challenge, which should take around 2 hours to complete.

## Functionality
The task is to develop UI tests in the preferred Javascript programming language. We have included files to create an initial suite with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

Your application should be built around the provided `test/interview.spec.js`.

## Notes
- You are expected to make your code at the best you can do. Itâ€™s not sufficient that it works, please ensure separation of test logic and cases.
- Please make frequent, and descriptive git commits.
- Use additional third-party libraries or not; your choice.
- Feel free to add more tests as you have time, but the suite provided is the priority.
- In the `package.json` of the project, is described exactly how to run the tests

## What we're looking for
- The functionality of the project matches the description above
- An ability to think through important potential cases

When complete, please push your code to Github to your own account and send the link to the project or zip the project (including the `.git` directory) and send it back.

Thank you and please ask if you have any questions!
